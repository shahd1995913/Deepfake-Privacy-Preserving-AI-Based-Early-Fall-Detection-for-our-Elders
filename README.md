# Deepfake Privacy-Preserving AI-Based Early Fall Detection for Our Elders 
## Done by Shahed Al-khateeb 2025 AUGUST 

### Overview
This repository contains the implementation of an AI-based system designed to **preserve privacy** while performing **early fall detection** for elderly individuals.  
The system leverages **deepfake-based face replacement techniques** to anonymize personal identities in video feeds, ensuring that privacy is maintained during real-time monitoring and analysis.

The solution integrates:  

1. **Face Anonymization via Deepfake Technology** – Replacing the detected faces with synthetic, non-identifiable faces while preserving head pose and expressions.

2. **Early Fall Detection using AI Models** – Utilizing deep learning techniques to detect and predict potential falls before or as they occur, allowing timely assistance and intervention.

## Key Features
- **Privacy-Preserving Video Processing**: Prevents the exposure of the elder’s actual facial identity by applying real-time face replacement.
- **Fall Detection Model**: Employs motion analysis and deep learning (e.g., CNNs/LSTMs) to identify unusual movement patterns that indicate a fall.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Capable of running on live video streams from surveillance or wearable cameras.
- **Modular Implementation**: Separate components for face anonymization and fall detection, allowing independent use or integration.

## How It Works
1. **Face Detection**: The system detects faces in the incoming video frames.  
2. **Face Replacement (Deepfake)**: Detected faces are replaced with synthetic faces generated to preserve expressions but anonymize identity.  
3. **Fall Prediction**: Motion features are extracted from the anonymized video and analyzed using the trained fall detection model.  
4. **Alert Mechanism**: When a fall is detected, the system can trigger alerts to caregivers or connected IoT devices.

## Applications
- **Elderly Care Homes**: Monitoring without compromising the dignity and privacy of residents.  
- **In-Home Care Systems**: Assisting family members in ensuring the safety of elderly relatives.  
- **Healthcare Research**: Providing anonymized datasets for developing safer AI monitoring tools.
